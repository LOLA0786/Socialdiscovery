# SocialDiscovery — Intent-Governed Social Discovery

SocialDiscovery is a privacy-first social discovery system built around **explicit intent**, not followers or engagement metrics.

## Core Idea
Every discovery action (recommend, match, trend) is expressed as a **normalized intent** and evaluated by a deterministic policy engine **before execution**.

This enables:
- Replayable decisions
- Shadow-mode safety
- Policy-based control
- Auditability by design

## Architecture
- Intent emission (discovery layer)
- Intent evaluation (policy engine)
- Shadow / allow / block modes
- Tamper-evident audit log
- Deterministic replay

## Current Status
- Shadow-mode intent engine
- Deterministic policy evaluation
- Replay CLI
- Synthetic simulation tests

## Not Yet Included
- Blocking enforcement (intentional)
- UI coupling (intent is backend-first)
- Identity-based heuristics

## Philosophy
> Don’t explain decisions. Prove them.

Built for trust, not engagement.
